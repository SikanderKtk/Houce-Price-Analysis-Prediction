# Houce-Price-Analysis-Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting house prices using real estate data. With the help of machine learning algorithms, the model can estimate the price of a house based on features like area, location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and more.

## Project Objective

To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts house prices using historical property data, helping buyers, sellers, and real estate businesses make informed decisions.
